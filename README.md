Hi, I'm Rafa!. I am an Artificial Intelligence Master student @ UC3M looking to develop my career in AI in health, aerospace or electronics industries. 
In this repository I will be including my work from inside and outside the Master prgram. I know it is a little bit messy but I am planning on tidying it up in the future.

I have some things planned for the future (appart from tidying it up):
- I recently got a new book about GNNs and I am planning on including projects and practical exercises.
- I will also be working on my Master thesis project code here!
- I have some courses left to take from the Master program so expect more content soon.
